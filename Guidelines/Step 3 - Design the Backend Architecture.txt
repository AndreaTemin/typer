To create a typing application similar to TenFastFingers, you can follow the steps outlined below to design the backend architecture.

1. Identify Core Components:
   - User Management: Handle user registration, authentication, ann  d authorization.
   - Typing Exercises: Store and manage typing lessons, exercises, and their corresponding texts.
   - Performance Tracking: Track and analyze user performance, including typing speed, accuracy, and progress.

2. Define Data Models:
   You can use an ORM like SQLAlchemy or Tortoise-ORM to define the data models. Here's an example of the data models you might need:

   - User: Represents a registered user.
     - Fields: id, username, email, password (hashed), created_at, updated_at

   - Lesson: Represents a typing lesson.
     - Fields: id, title, description, created_at, updated_at

   - Exercise: Represents a typing exercise within a lesson.
     - Fields: id, lesson_id (foreign key to Lesson), text, created_at, updated_at

   - Result: Represents the user's performance for a specific exercise.
     - Fields: id, user_id (foreign key to User), exercise_id (foreign key to Exercise), duration, accuracy, created_at

3. Design API Endpoints:
   Using FastAPI's routing mechanism, you can design the following API endpoints:

   - User Registration: `POST /api/register`
   - User Login: `POST /api/login`
   - Fetch Typing Lessons: `GET /api/lessons`
   - Fetch Exercises for a Lesson: `GET /api/lessons/{lesson_id}/exercises`
   - Submit Exercise Results: `POST /api/exercises/{exercise_id}/results`

4. Implement Functionality for API Endpoints:
   - User Registration: Validate user input, create a new user record in the database.
   - User Login: Validate credentials, generate and return a JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication.
   - Fetch Typing Lessons: Retrieve all lessons from the database and return as a JSON response.
   - Fetch Exercises for a Lesson: Retrieve exercises associated with the given lesson ID and return as a JSON response.
   - Submit Exercise Results: Validate input, calculate performance metrics (e.g., duration, accuracy), store the result in the database.

5. Additional Considerations:
   - Authentication and Authorization: Use JWT-based authentication to secure your API endpoints and ensure that only authenticated users can access protected routes.
   - Error Handling: Implement proper error handling and return appropriate error responses with relevant status codes.
   - Database Integration: Connect your backend application to a suitable database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) using an ORM to store and retrieve data efficiently.

Remember to break down the implementation of each step into smaller tasks and focus on one aspect at a time. This approach will help you effectively design and build your typing application's backend architecture.
